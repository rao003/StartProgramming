```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Input Measurements**: Use the functions in `measurements.py` to input and validate field dimensions.
2. **Perform Calculations**: Utilize the methods in `bridge_calculations.py` to compute load, span, and other structural parameters.
3. **Run the Application**: Execute `main.py` to run the application and see the results of your measurements and calculations.

## Functionality

- **Field Measurements**: The application allows users to input and validate measurements necessary for placing the rolling base.
- **Bridge Calculations**: It provides calculations for various structural parameters essential for bridge design.
